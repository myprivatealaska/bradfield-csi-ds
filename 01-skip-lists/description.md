In this class, we discuss the skip list, an efficient and easy-to-implement alternative to balanced binary search trees. Let's be honest: nobody wants to implement and debug a red-black tree, but all of us want an in-memory data structure for fast access into an ordered collection.

By the end of this class, you should understand the design, implementation, and approximate runtime of a skip list. In addition, you should be able to:

* Identify when skip lists would be useful
* Understand multiple approaches to ordered collections and the tradeoffs between them
* Distinguish between different ways a data structure can be "probablistic"
